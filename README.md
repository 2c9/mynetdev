By default in the command line you have only few commands. But if you enter hidden command "_cmdline-mode on" then you are prompted to confirm this command: "All commands can be displayed and executed. Continue? [Y/N]" â€“ need to press "y" followed by a request to enter the factory password. The password depends on your device model.
